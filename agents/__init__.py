# AGENTS PACKAGE - __init__.py
# =============================================================================
# This file marks the 'agents' directory as a Python package.
# It allows us to import agents using: from agents.schema_agent import schema_agent
#
# We could also re-export all agents here for convenience, but keeping imports
# explicit in graph.py makes dependencies clearer for learning purposes.
