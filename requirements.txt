# REQUIREMENTS.TXT - Project Dependencies
# =============================================================================
# This file lists all the Python packages needed to run the multi-agent
# data analyst application. Install them with: pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# Each package serves a specific purpose in the system:
# - langchain: Core framework for building LLM-powered applications
# - langchain-openai: OpenAI-specific integrations for LangChain
# - langgraph: Graph-based orchestration for multi-agent workflows
# - langchain-mcp-adapters: Loads MCP tools as LangChain-compatible tools
# - streamlit: Web UI framework for building data apps
# - plotly: Interactive charting library (better than matplotlib for web)
# - pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
# - python-dotenv: Load environment variables from .env file
# - mcp: Model Context Protocol SDK for connecting to MCP servers
#
# NOTE: mcp-google-sheets is NOT listed here. It is installed and run
# separately via uvx (part of the uv package manager). The MCP server
# runs as a standalone local process that communicates via stdio transport.
# Install uv with: pip install uv
# Test the MCP server with: uvx mcp-google-sheets@latest
