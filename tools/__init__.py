# TOOLS PACKAGE - __init__.py
# =============================================================================
# This file marks the 'tools' directory as a Python package.
# It allows us to import tools using: from tools.python_executor import execute_code
#
# TOOLS vs AGENTS:
# - Tools are reusable functions that perform specific tasks
# - Agents are orchestration nodes that use tools and manage state
# Keeping them in separate packages reinforces this distinction.
